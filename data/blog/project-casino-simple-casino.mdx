# Project Showcase: Simple Casino

Very basic casino system, with basic user system and external slots integration completely working.

As challenge for myself this was made within 24 hours time-span to test how fast I can work from ground-up software in future (I like challenging myself).

Available on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/ivanmontikfan/pavel-casino-software).
